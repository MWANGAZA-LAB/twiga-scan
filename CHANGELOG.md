## Development Notes

This project started as a simple Bitcoin QR scanner and evolved into a comprehensive Lightning Network authentication platform. The development process involved:

- **Week 1**: Basic QR scanning and Bitcoin URI parsing
- **Week 2**: Lightning Network integration and provider verification
- **Week 3**: Database integration and user management
- **Week 4**: Production deployment and monitoring setup

### Key Decisions Made During Development

1. **Technology Stack**: Chose FastAPI for backend due to async support and automatic API docs
2. **Database**: Started with SQLite, migrated to PostgreSQL for production
3. **Frontend**: React with TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
4. **Containerization**: Docker for consistent deployment across environments
5. **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana for observability

### Lessons Learned

- QR code parsing requires extensive edge case handling
- Lightning Network standards are constantly evolving
- Real-time verification adds significant complexity
- Mobile-first design is crucial for QR scanning apps
- Database schema changes require careful migration planning
